## Script `manual_selection.sh`

### Description

This script uses [imagemagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) tools to generate a animated gif.

Note that this script will generate several images that can end up being automatically deleted (see the `delete_temporary_images` parameter).  
I strongly recommend to never save your files in the folder used by this script (by default : ${HOME}/Images/norben_animated_gifs)


### Usage

Open a terminal, and run the following command :

```sh
/<path>/<to>/manual_selection.sh
```

Optionally you can use `alt+tab` keyboard shortcut to switch to the correct application window.

Then select the region on the screen that will be saved as a animated gif image.


### Parameters

Edit the `/<path>/<to>/manual_selection.sh` file to modify parameters :

* `cmd_convert`: path to the imagemagick convert tool
* `cmd_import`: path to the imagemagick import tool

* `images_folder`: path to the folder that will contain images files generated by this script
* `img_test_file`: temporary file used to determine which part of the screen will be saved

* `image_name`: part of the name of the generated image files
* `image_extension`: extension of the temporary image files
* `duration_in_seconds`: total duration a screen capture
* `frequency_per_second`: tells how many temporary images will be saved per second

* `delete_temporary_images`: determines if temporary images files generated by the script will be deleted or not
  * if it equals `"0"`, they will be deleted
  * if it equals `"1"`, they won't (well, in fact pretty much any value except from "0" will work the same way as "1")
